= About backlog

Backlog is a backlog management system. It provides web-based and
text-based operation.

== Categories

Items are sorted in categories.

Every new item starts as an Epic. This is basically an uncategorized
entry which needs review to be advanced to another category.

* Epic
* Story (doable within a sprint)
* InProgress (currently being worked on)
* Done (finished stuff, waits here until release)
* Released (shipped to customer)

Internally, categories are sub-directories below the main dir. 


== Sorting

The files below a category define the items. There's one file per item.

All items within each category are ordered. The order is defined in
the <category>/.order file.

The .order file is text-based and lists one file (without <category>
prefix) per line. Files not appearing in .order will be added
automatically.

The backlog system will also add the item subject to the .order file.
This improves readability and also helps with internal caching.


== Implementation

The basis is 'git' and the architecture follows gits style of
'plumbing' and 'porcellain'. Here git is the plumbing and the Rails
application is the porcellain.

Each category lives in its own sub-directory and has a separate order
